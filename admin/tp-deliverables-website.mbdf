When setting up your team repo, you would be configuring **the GitHub Pages feature to publish your documentation** as a website.

{{ icon_tip }} **Some common sense tips for a good product screenshot**

`Ui.png` represents your product in its full glory.
* Before taking the screenshot, populate the product with data that makes the product look good. For example, if the product is supposed to show profile photos, use real profile photos instead of dummy placeholders.
* If the product doesn't have nice line wrapping for long inputs/outputs, don't use such inputs/outputs for the screenshot.
* It should show a state in which the product is well-populated %%i.e., don't leave data panels largely blank%%.
* Choose a state that showcases the main features of the product %%i.e., the login screen is not usually a good choice%%.
* Take a _clean_ screenshot with a decent resolution. Some screenshot tools can capture a specified window only. If your tool cannot do that, make sure you crop away the extraneous parts captured by the screenshot.
* Avoid annotations (arrows, callouts, explanatory text etc.); it should look like the product is in use for real.

* **Use a suitable profile photo.**
<div id="profile-photo" class="indented-level2">

The purpose of the profile photo is for the reader to identify you. Therefore, choose a ==recent individual photo showing your face clearly== (i.e., not too small) -- somewhat similar to a passport photo. Given below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.<br>
<img src="{{baseUrl}}/admin/images/profilephotos.png" style="width: 365.33px">

If you are uncomfortable posting your photo due to security reasons, you can post a lower resolution image so that it is hard for someone to misuse that image for fraudulent purposes. If you are concerned about privacy, you may use [a placeholder image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_placeholder.png) in place of the photo in module-related documents that are publicly visible.
