<ul>
<li>Tutorials will be conducted using Zoom.</li>
<li>MS Teams will be used for file sharing.</li>
<li>A tutorial group is handled by two tutors. Each tutor will work with two teams.</li>
<li>The tutor will <em>facilitate</em> tutorial activities, observe your progress, and give feedback.</li></ul>

<br>
<p><strong>Slides and tutorial recordings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Zoom recording of a tutorial will be made available to you after the tutorial.</li>
<li><span class="text-danger">Slides used in tutorials will not be distributed to students.</span> You are expected to take notes (or screenshots) during the tutorial as necessary.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The role of our tutors</strong> is different from tutors in other modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Not a source of admin information</strong>: Given the humongous amount of admin info contained in this module and the fact that it is constantly evolving, tutors may not be aware of the recent subtle changes to the admin information. To safeguard you from receiving incorrect admin info, tutors are prohibited from answering admin queries. If you have an admin query, please post in the <a href="https://github.com/nus-tic4002-AY2021S2/forum/issues">forum</a> (or email the prof at <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>tic4002@comp.nus.edu.sg</code> but only if the question is not appropriate for the forum).</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>No inputs for yet-to-be-graded components</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving inputs for components not graded yet. <span class="dimmed">Reason: work submitted for grading should be your own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving direct technical help, other than to give you some general direction to finding a solution. <span class="dimmed">Rationale: We want you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="dimmed"><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-info-circle"></span></span> This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between <em>refactoring</em> and <em>rewriting</em>?</span></p>

<p><strong>Keep in mind that instructors don't have ready solutions to all technical problems</strong>. Unlike tutorial questions for which instructors have model solutions, given the complexity of industry tools we use (Gradle, GitHub, Git, ...) and the rapid pace they are updated, instructors don't have ready solutions to most technical problems you face in this module. The only realistic way to solve those problems at a large scale is crowd-sourcing i.e., someone else who faced a similar problem might know how to fix it.</p>
<p><span class="text-danger"><big><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> <strong>What not to do:</strong></big></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-danger"><strong>Send a help request to an instructor</strong>:</span> When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don't fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.<br></li>
<li><span class="text-danger"><strong>Request to meet the instructor to solve the problem</strong>:</span> That can only work if the person is supposed to know how to solve all technical problems, which is almost never the case.</li></ul>
<p><span class="text-success"><big><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> <strong>What to do:</strong></big></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Double-check the given instructions</strong>: Often, technical problems arise due to deviations in how you perform a step or a difference in your environment.<br></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get your team to meet for a weekly work-together session</strong>. When you do module tasks together, it is easy to compare with each other and figure out what deviation is causing the problem. That is, crowd-source your team first.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br>
Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a web search on the error message is a good starting point.  <br>
<pic src="/website/admin/images/how to google it.png" width="600"></pic></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask in the <a href="https://github.com/nus-tic4002-AY2021S2/forum/issues">module forum</a></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Give full details of the problem</strong> Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give a meaningful title to the post. Be as specific as you can.<br>
<font color="red"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-down"></span></span> Bad</strong></span></font> <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>testing problem</code><br>
<font color="green"><span><strong><span><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></span></span> Good</strong></span></font> <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>runtest.bat fails with ClassNotFound error</code></li>
<li>Include full error message, screenshots, code snippets, stack traces, etc.<br>
<span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span> Note that it is better to give code in text form rather than as screenshots, to allow others to easily copy-paste the code in their reply.<br>
<span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span> You can use <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown, and GFM</a> syntax when posting in the forum.</li>
<li>If the problem is code-related, share the full code if possible (e.g., push the current state of the code to a branch in your fork and give the link to the branch). That gives a chance for someone to reproduce the state of your project in their computer. Sharing just a snippet of your choosing might not be enough as the problem may not be where you think it is.</li></ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid addressing the question to one person</strong> (e.g., the prof), unless really necessary. Doing so will discourage others from answering that question.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolate the problem.</strong> &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself (have you heard about <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:appendixHelp-rubberDuckDebugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</trigger>?).</p>
<box>
<p><span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning"><span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-lightbulb"></span></span> How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.
</p></box><p></p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generalize the problem.</strong> &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file using Java&quot;.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remember to thank those you try to help, and close the issue</strong> after the issue has been resolved.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share the solution</strong>. If you eventually managed to solve the problem on your own, share the solution in the thread for the benefit of others, and give closure to those who tried to help you. Don't leave the thread hanging or close it with something like <code class="hljs inline no-lang" v-pre>Never mind. I figured it out</code>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't <em>hijack</em> other threads</strong>: It is OK to chime in if you have the same problem as the <span data-mb-component-type="tooltip" v-b-tooltip.hover.top.html="tooltipInnerContentGetter" class="trigger"><span data-mb-slot-name="_content">Original Poster</span>OP</span> but don't ask a different (even if somewhat related) question in someone else's thread. That prevents the OP from closing the thread after the original question has been resolved. Instead, post your question as a separate thread.</p></li></ul></li></ul>

<p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

<p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>

<li>You are expected to be present on time. <mark>Punctuality is considered for participation marks.</mark></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In the past, many students have requested to increase the tutorial duration because a mere hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try to make the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time. Note that <mark>the better prepared you are, the higher the chance of completing e all activities allocated to a tutorial</mark> within time.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your conduct in tutorials will be evaluated by team members and the tutor which can affect your participation marks.</li></ul></div></panel></div>
