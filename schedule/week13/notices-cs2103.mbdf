Please note that ==tutors will not be available for consultations _after_ this week== (doesn't apply to this week). As most tutors are UG students who have their own exams, we do not allow {{ module_pair }} students to take up tutors' time during the reading week and the exam period. This is especially important for {{ module_pair }} tutors as they have to spend a significant time on moderating bug reports in the last phase of the PE.

Any questions related to the module should be posted in the [forum]({{ url_forum }}) (preferred) or sent to the prof.
