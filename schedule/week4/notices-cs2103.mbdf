{{ icon_important_big_red }} We strongly recommend you to **have a team project meeting _before_ the tutorial**. Do the following during the meeting:

* **Help each other finish iP tasks.** Tasks allocated to this week are especially troublesome and some peer help can be very useful.
* **Dealing with technical problems**:
